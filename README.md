# monkey-rs

A Rust implementation of the monkey programming language as described in Thorsten Balls brilliant book 'Writing an Interpreter in Go' (https://interpreterbook.com)

This was my first project in Rust, so the code is probably very far from perfect and also not even close to as efficient as it could be (lots of (mostly unnecessary) .clones() to kind of cheat the borrow checker)
